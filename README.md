# OTA_Update_File_Prepare

Previously, for this test, it was necessary to convert the software version numbers to hexadecimal by separating them by twos. We were splitting binary files manually with the Perl program. By entering the decimal software version, project, dcf, lower and upper version restrictions, country, brand and mac address restrictions into the system, a program was written that can run as an exe file on computers that do not have Python installed. Thus, people who do not know Python could also use the program and prepare the files.
